# Self-Balancing Minibike

**This project was inspired by the Arduino Engineering Kit Rev 2**, which features a self-balancing motorcycle controlled via MATLAB and Simulink.  
Instead of using the kit, I built my own version from scratch using independently sourced components, C++ programming, and custom 3D-printed parts.

## Project

Using AutoCAD and the Arduino IDE, I will design and implement a model motorcycle which will utilize a weighted flywheel to balance itself.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to teach myself the fundamentals of physics as they apply to small robotic systems.  
As a traditional computer science student, I see this as a hands-on way to apply and reinforce the skills I’ve learned in class, while also expanding my knowledge into areas like embedded systems, electronics, and real-world control theory.
